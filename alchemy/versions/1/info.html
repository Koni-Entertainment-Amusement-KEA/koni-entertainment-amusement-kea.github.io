    <title>Alchemy Engine 1.0</title>
    <h1>Alchemy Engine 1.0 Information</h1>
    <p>Work in Progress</p>

    <h2>According to the TXT file... (just a test)</h2>
    <p>
    This folder is just meant to be as a "template", the actual one used by the game 
    is hidden in the files (in the root), so by changing the files present you won't
    have to worry about breaking the game since it relies on the engine.</p>
    
    <p>The Alchemy Engine is an engine with a standard for graphics aside from scripts
    that are helpful for making your games. You can modify the graphics by going
    into \SCR\ALCHEMY_Graphics.cs (Windows 7 file structure). But at it's core
    it's meant to recreate the look of a PlayStation 2/arcade game from 2006.</p>
    
    <p>You can go however you want with the graphics and engine code itself. You can
    make any game you want, it has templates for all kinds of games. There
    is no standard for what you can make. You can even make animations/machinimas
    with it.</p>
